# ⚾ MLB Betting Model Assistant

Welcome to the MLB Betting Model Assistant — a Streamlit-powered app for modeling **true probabilities** on MLB games and player props. This tool is designed to help generate smarter, data-backed bets using Statcast and betting market inputs.

---

##  Project Goals

- Build a true **win probability model** for MLB games
- Model **player props** using real data: recent performance, pitcher/bullpen matchups, etc.
- Calculate **Expected Value (EV)** to highlight strong or weak bets
- Make betting decisions based on stats, not gut feelings

##  Why This Exists

Hi, I’m an **active duty Navy Corpsman with 18 years of service currently forward deployed.**. In my limited free time, I’m teaching myself Python and building this project as a way to combine my love for baseball and numbers.

Like many others, I’ve placed bets based on intuition — and I’ve lost too much when theres always been a science to it with math and historical stats. I wanted to stop guessing so I started to try betting with an edge. growing my own personal model little by litte.

This is a personal project built with:
- Time I don’t really have
- Skills I’m still learning
- Passion for building something smarter

##  Looking for Help

I'm not a developer by trade — just someone who’s learning as I go. If you're experienced in Python, machine learning, betting models, or baseball analytics:

**I'd love your help.**

- Got a better way to calculate win probabilities?
- Want to improve the prop model?
- See a data source I should add?

Pull requests, forks, and feedback are **all welcome**. I want to keep improving this and maybe one day grow it into something much bigger.
